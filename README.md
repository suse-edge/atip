## Scenarios

Note that ipv6, dual-stack and aarch64 scenarios are currently tech-preview and not yet fully supported.

- Single-node Clusters
- Multi-node Clusters
- DHCP Network scenarios, single or dual-stack
- DHCP-less Network scenarios, single or dual-stack
- Air gap scenarios for management cluster
- Additional cacerts to use external TLS file server for managment cluster (to server images over HTTPS)
- Air gap scenarios for downstream clusters
- CPU Manager scenarios
- AARCH64 architecture:
  1. Tech Preview for full aarch64 e2e, mgmt-cluster and downstream clusters using aarch64 architecture
  2. x86_64 Management clusters to deploy both x86_64 and aarch64 downstream clusters
